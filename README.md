# 🔓 Wi-Fi Cracking Using Aircrack-ng | Information Security Project
This project demonstrates two real-world Wi-Fi password cracking scenarios using the powerful Aircrack-ng suite. It explores vulnerabilities in WPA/WPA2-secured networks by capturing handshakes and launching dictionary-based offline attacks.

⚙️ Use Cases Covered
- 📶 WPA2 Handshake Capture using Deauthentication Attack
- 📡 Wi-Fi Password Cracking using Dictionary Attack

Each use case includes detailed steps, Linux commands, screenshots, and real-world testing using monitor mode and injection techniques.


## 🧠 Tools Used
- Aircrack-ng Suite
- Airmon-ng / Airodump-ng / Aireplay-ng
- Kali Linux
- Wordlist (dictionary)

## 📁 Project Contents
- ✅ Complete PDF Report with commands and screenshots
- ✅ Two documented use cases with successful Wi-Fi password cracking
- ✅ MITRE ATT&CK and OSI Layer mapping
- ✅ Proposed mitigation strategies (WPA3, MAC filtering, deauth detection)

📍 Developed as part of the Information Security course at
University of Management and Technology (UMT), Sialkot
